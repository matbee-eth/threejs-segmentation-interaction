# Project Overview

This project demonstrates various graphical effects and simulations using React components. The main file, `page.tsx`, imports and renders different components to showcase these effects.

## Components

### ImageDistortion
This component applies a distortion effect to an image. It is currently commented out in the `page.tsx` file.

### ClothSimulation
This component simulates cloth physics. It can be used to apply a cloth-like effect to an image. It is also commented out in the `page.tsx` file.

### BasicScene
This component sets up a basic 3D scene. It is another option that is currently commented out in the `page.tsx` file.

### MembraneEffect
This component applies a membrane-like effect and is the default component being rendered in `page.tsx`.

## Usage

To switch between different effects, uncomment the desired component in the `page.tsx` file and comment out the others. For example, to use the `ClothSimulation` component, modify the file as follows:
